# Ohayo - Raspberry Pi audio stream alarm clock
This project turns a Rasberry Pi into a "radio" alarm clock.  It uses a Bootstrap-based web interface so you can control
the RPi from any web browser, but most conveniently, on your mobile device. The project will work with any supported audio adaptor,
including the RPi built-in audio.  My favorite audio adaptor is the Sabrent USB External Stereo Sound Adapter.  It is less than $10
and sounds really good.
